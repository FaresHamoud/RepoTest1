HTML Questions

Wat is HTML?
TML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

Wat zijn HTML attributen?
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

Attributes may only be specified within start tags and must never be used in end tags.





Wat is HTML semantics?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.




Waarvoor worden meta tags gebruikt?
The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
Search engines such as Google use metadata from meta tags to understand additional information about the webpage. They can use this information for ranking purposes, to display snippets in search results, and sometimes they can ignore meta tags. Example of meta tags include the <title> and <description> elements.


Wat is een nested element?
A nested element, also called a child element, can be a parent element too if other elements are nested within it. HTML tags should be nested in correct order. They must be closed in the inverse order of how they are defined, that means the last tag opened must be closed first.

Wat is het verschil tussen inline- en blok-elementen?


An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.



A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

Wat is accessibility?
Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections

A good foundation of accessibility for people with cognitive impairments includes:

Delivering content in more than one way, such as by text-to-speech or by video.
Easily understood content, such as text written using plain-language standards.
Focusing attention on important content.
Minimizing distractions, such as unnecessary content or advertisements.
Consistent webpage layout and navigation.
Familiar elements, such as underlined links blue when not visited and purple when visited.
Dividing processes into logical, essential steps with progress indicators.
Website authentication as easy as possible without compromising security.
Making forms easy to complete, such as with clear error messages and simple error recovery.
